class ImageSynapse(bt.Synapse):
    """
    A protocol representation for image restoration tasks.
    This protocol helps in handling request and response communication between
    the miner and the validator for image restoration tasks.

    Attributes:
        image_to_restore (str): The degraded/low-quality image as a base64-encoded string
                                that needs to be restored by the miner. This is an immutable field.
                                This field is not included in the response from miner.

        task_name (str): Identifier for the type of restoration task. This is an immutable field.

        target_metadata (Dict[str, Any]): Metadata about the original high-quality image,
                                         including its width, height, and format. This information
                                         helps miners generate better restorations by knowing
                                         the target dimensions. This is an immutable field.
                                         Keys include 'width', 'height', and 'format'.

        restored_image (str): The restored high-quality image provided by the miner as a
                              base64-encoded string response. Initially empty, filled by the miner.
